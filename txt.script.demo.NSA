Hi, We're Team Out Of Space


Our project, Xplor, allows users to to interact and learn about planetary geology tools through basic facts and 3D models.

These objects are 3D printable and assesible at any moment.

We were inspired to choose this challenge because it seemed like  a believable way to help astronauts explore furthur into space(hence, our motto "Beyond The
Planets."
